## Shared Infrastructure Requirements

### Cloudflare Pages Deployment

All three sites should use Cloudflare Pages with the same deployment pattern:

**Workflow File: `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yml`**
```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
    name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
        uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          projectName: [PROJECT_NAME_HERE]
          directory: .
          gitHubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Project Names:**
- westover.dev → `westover-dev`
- westover.expert → `westover-expert`
- westover.services → `westover-services`

### DNS Configuration

Each site needs a CNAME file in the root:

**westover.dev/CNAME:**
```
westover.dev
```

**westover.expert/CNAME:**
```
westover.expert
```

**westover.services/CNAME:**
```
westover.services
```
